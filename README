mprand is two things: the author's idea of a Tcl learning exercise, and a
special-purpose mpd client to random-play from the entire mpd database
(currently only with uniform distribution). It improves upon one other
implementation of this concept of which I'm aware (Josh Kunz' ashuffle -
https://github.com/Joshkunz/ashuffle) in two major respects; it does not rely on
the deprecated 'listall' mpd request (which can quickly become prohibitively
expensive with large databases over the network), and it ensures that there is
always at least two songs in the queue, so that playback is continuous (mpd's
gapless playback can function, and the built-in http streaming server will not
go down between songs).

USAGE

At the moment this script accepts no options; simply execute it from this source
directory, and it will begin random-playing on localhost:6600. Random play
continues until another client stops playback, at which point mprand will
terminate.
