mprand is a special-purpose mpd client to random-play from the entire mpd
database (currently only with uniform distribution). It improves upon one other
implementation of this concept of which I'm aware (Josh Kunz' ashuffle -
https://github.com/Joshkunz/ashuffle) in two major respects; it does not rely on
the deprecated 'listall' mpd request (which can quickly become prohibitively
expensive with large databases over the network), and it ensures that there are
always at least two songs in the queue, so that playback is continuous (mpd's
gapless playback can function, and the built-in http streaming server will not
go down between songs); this also serves as a primitive yet elegant "up next"
feature.

The code mprand uses to talk to MPD is factored into a package named mpd_proto;
this may prove useful as the nucleus of an MPD client library for some other
purpose; expanding mpd_proto into a full MPD client library for Tcl is a long-
term goal.

USAGE

At the moment this script accepts no options; simply execute it, and it will
begin random-playing on localhost:6600 (or the host and port specified by
MPD_HOST and MPD_PORT, if these environment variables are set). Random play
continues until another client stops playback, at which point mprand will
terminate. Note that the mpd_proto/ directory must be located somewhere in
Tcl's package search path; the easiest way to accomplish this is to set
TCLLIBPATH="." or something to that effect in the environment.
